 * @author 2021-08-31 kjpeters  Working and cleaned up version.
 * @author 2022-01-07 kjpeters  Adjust gcc releases for GCOV_COUNTERS.
 *
 * @note Based on GCOV-related code of the Linux kernel,
 * as described online by Thanassis Tsiodras (April 2016)
 * https://www.thanassis.space/coverage.html
 * and by Alexander Tarasikov
 * http://allsoftwaresucks.blogspot.com/2015/05/gcov-is-amazing-yet-undocumented.html
 * with additional investigation, updating, cleanup, and portability
 * by Ken Peters.
 *
 * @brief Private header file for embedded gcov.
 *
 **********************************************************************/
/*
 * This code is based on the GCOV-related code of the Linux kernel (kept under
 * "kernel/gcov"). It basically uses the convert_to_gcda function to generate
 * the .gcda files information upon application completion, and dump it on the
 * host filesystem via GDB scripting.
 *
 * Original Linux banner follows below - but note that the Linux guys have
 * nothing to do with these modifications, so blame me (and contact me)
 * if something goes wrong.
